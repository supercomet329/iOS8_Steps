## Introduction

One of the new features in iOS8 and Xcode 6 that has maybe slipped under the
radar a little is an update in the ways you can specify launch screens.
Traditionally, these have been images which are display immediately on app
launch, before the live app UI is ready to go. With the introduction of the new
screen sizes of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the lack of scalability of the
image-based approach is starting to show. Luckily, you can now provide a
storyboard or XIB file which will be used as the launch screen, across all
flavors of device.

Today's article will take a look at how (and why) to upgrade an app which was
built using Xcode 5 to use the new XIB-based approach. As such there is an
accompanying app that demonstrates the usage - available on the ShinobiControls
github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

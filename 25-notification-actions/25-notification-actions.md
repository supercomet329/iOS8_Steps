## Introduction

Local and remote notifications have been an integral part of iOS for many years
now - allowing apps to respond to events even whilst they aren't running.
Notifications are either silent or visual, with visual notifications taking the
form of alerts or banners which the user can interact with. The interaction is
very limited though - either dismissing the notification or opening the app.

iOS8 introduces new notification actions - which allow you to hook into the
notification system and provide a set of customized actions that the user will
see and can execute alongside the notification.

Today's post digs into the new notification actions by creating a simple timer
app based on local notifications. Exactly the same principles apply for
providing custom actions for remote notifications too - just using push
notifications as a trigger. The sample application is called __NotifyTimely__
and the source code is available on github at

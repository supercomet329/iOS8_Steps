## Introduction

It is not unreasonable to want to use custom fonts in your apps, and it has been
possible to do so for a while on iOS. However, it has always been troublesome
designing the UI in Interface Builder, since you have to build your interface
with the system font. The resulted in building and running your app repeatedly
to get the desired result.

Well, Xcode 6 finally changes this! Now, any custom fonts present in your app's
bundle will be available in Interface Builder, and will render as they would
look in your running. This will be a noticeable jump in productivity, and you'll
learn how easy it is to use in today's day-by-day article.

There isn't really any source _code_ associated with today's post, but there is
a project which demonstrates the functionality. The code is available on github
at [github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

## Declaring fonts for use within your app


## Conclusion

Today's was quite a short post, but it represents a fix in Interface Builder which
has been niggling at developers for a long time. I think that the little bits
and pieces like this that Apple has been working on within the developer toolset
demonstrates their commitment to making the process much more friendly.

As ever, the demo project is available on github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

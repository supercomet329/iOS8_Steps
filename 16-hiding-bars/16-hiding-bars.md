## Introduction

Today's post is quite a short one - a snippet if you will, but that makes it no
less interesting or useful. Back in iOS7, Safari introduced the ability to show
and hide the navigation and tool bars by tapping or swiping. This really
allowed the content to shine through - reducing the proportion of the screen
dedicated to less-useful chrome at appropriate times.

In iOS8 the navigation controller has been updated with some additional
properties which offer this functionality out-the-box. In today's post you'll
learn about how to use it and how you can configure it to behave exactly as you
want.

There is a small accompanying project which is available in the iOS8 Day-by-Day

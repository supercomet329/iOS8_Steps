## Introduction

The __CoreMotion__ framework is used in iOS to receive data from the plethora of
motion sensors available on a device. This includes the magnetometer, the
pedometer and the gyroscope. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include an altimeter, so
CoreMotion has been updated to support this new sensor. iOS8 also sees some
other changes to the framework.

In today's blog post you'll see what replaces `CMStepCounter` due to its
deprecation, and the new type of activity classification available. There is an
accompanying app called __LocoMotion__ that demonstrates both how to present
live motion data, and how to query for historical data. You can grab the source
code from the ShinobiControls github at

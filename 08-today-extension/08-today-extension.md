## Introduction

Way back on day two of this blog series we took a look at the new sharing extension -
which is just one of six new extension points on iOS. Today, it's the chance of
the today extension, or widget.

Widgets allow you to add content to the today screen on a device. Until iOS8, this
area has been sacred - with only system apps being allowed to display anything
there. This new extension point will allow you to bring small amounts of relevant
info to your users, in an easily accessible fashion.

The project which accompanies this project is based around the Github user public
event feed. The app itself shows the most recent events, and the today widget
shows just the latest event. Throughout this post you'll learn how to create a
today extension, how to share code with the app, how to share cached data with
the app and how to communicate from the widget to the app.

The code for this project is available on Github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iO8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS80-day-by-day).

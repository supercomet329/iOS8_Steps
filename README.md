iOS8-day-by-day
===============

Apple delivered iOS 8 to the developer world at WWDC in June 2014, before
launching it at the wider world in September of the same year. The iOS 8
SDK was somewhat over-shadowed by the simultaneous announcement of a new
programming language in the form of Swift, however this didn't mean that
the core OS had been overlooked at all. Quite the opposite - a huge number
of new APIs had been introduced, powering tons of new functionality.

iOS8: Day-by-Day is a review of the most important of these. Busy developers
don't have time to trawl the WWDC videos and Apple documentation. Instead 
they'd like to get a high-level summary of the new possibilities, alongside
some working sample code. This is exactly what iOS8: Day-by-Day provides.
It started out as a blog series, and these blog posts now form the basis
of the book.

This repo contains all the source code associated with each of the articles,
allowing you to see each of the new technologies in action.

## Book

iOS8 Day-by-Day is now a published eBook. You can get hold of your copy
from Leanpub at
[leanpub.com/ios8daybyday](https://leanpub.com/ios8daybyday).


## Blog Series

iOS8 Day-by-Day is a blog series which dives into all the new features
available for developers in iOS8. You can read more about it and find an index
of the currently published posts here at
[shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay).

This repo is a collection of projects which accompany the series. Every single
blog post has a project which demonstrates the functionality in-action, rather
than just being a purely theoretical overview of the technology.

iOS8-day-by-day
===============

iOS8 Day-by-Day is a blog series which dives into all the new features
available for developers in iOS8. You can read more about it and find an index
of the currently published posts here at
[shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/iOS8DayByDay).

This repo is a collection of projects which accompany the series. Every single
blog post has a project which demonstrates the functionality in-action, rather
than just being a purely theoretical overview of the technology.


If you have any suggestions / ideas / comments please feel free to catch me on
twitter at [@iwantmyrealname](https://twitter.com/iwantmyrealname), and do fork
the repo and have a play around with the code!

## Introduction

It has always been hard work to get content from one app to another on iOS.
Although possible, it is not generally a well-understood workflow, and therefore
results in users deciding that it is not possible.

This is set to change in iOS8 with the introduction of the unified document
picker view controller. This allows you to present UI from within your app which
allows the user to select documents which are present within iCloud drive, on
iCloud but managed by another app, and also from 3rd party document providers.

Today's post is a very brief introduction into what you can do and how to do it.
It isn't an introduction to working with documents on iOS. Or an introduction to
using CloudKit. Or an introduction to building your own document providers. If
you want those then shout at me and I might write them. There is a basic sample
app which accompanies the post - as ever available on the ShinobiControls github
at [github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/iOS8-day-by-day).

## Introduction

Adaptive UI is probably the most important concept to be introduced in iOS8. It
might not seem like it at first, but abstracting the UI away from dependencies
on things like device and orientation, allows closer concentration on the desgin
itself, and less on the mechanics of implementation.

The most significant aspect to adaptive UI in iOS8 is adaptive layout - that is
layout which can automatically change depending on particular characteristics
of the container.

This leads on to having universal storyboards - i.e. a single storyboard which
can be used on multiple devices. This might well make storyboards an even more
attractive proposition.

Today's post will give a quick introduction to adaptive layout in iOS8. The
accompanying project demonstrates a universal storyboard, with varying layouts.
It's available as part of the github repo at

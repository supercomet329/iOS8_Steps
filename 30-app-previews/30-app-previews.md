## Introduction

The screenshots that adorn your app's page in the App Store have always been
incredibly important in advertising your app - giving a flavor of what a user
can expect and attempting to get them to push the all-important __Buy__ button.
Back when iOS7 was first announced I wrote a blog post about how given the new,
flatter UI design, screenshots just weren't going to cut it any more 
([iOS7: What does it mean for developers?](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2013/07/01/ios7-what-does-it-mean-for-developers)),
and it seems that Apple agree. Starting with iOS8, you can now upload a short
video to demo your app, to be displayed alongside the screenshots in the App
Store.

In today's article you'll learn how to create these videos, and take a look at
some of the recommendations from Apple regarding their content. Since it's still
early days in the video approval process, there is little empirical evidence
as to how strictly the rules are applied - with time the community will learn
both what what works, and what Apple is happy to approve.

In a change to the standard format, today's post doesn't have a sample project.
It does describe how to get started with recording video from your device - with
a sample demoing the __MarqueeMaker__ action extension from day 29.

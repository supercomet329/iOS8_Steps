## Introduction

It won't have gone unnoticed that at WWDC this year, in addition to announcing
iOS8, they also introduced a new programming language in the form of Swift. This
is quite a different language from objective-C in that it is strongly-typed and
includes some features common to more modern languages.

In the interests of embracing anything and everything that's new and shiny, this
blog series will exclusively use Swift.

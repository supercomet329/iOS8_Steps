## Introduction

It won't have gone unnoticed that at WWDC this year, in addition to announcing
iOS8, they also introduced a new programming language in the form of Swift. This
is quite a different language from objective-C in that it is strongly-typed and
includes some features common to more modern languages.

In the interests of embracing anything and everything that's new and shiny, this
blog series will exclusively use Swift. There is a wealth of information out
there about how to learn Swift, and how to interact with the Cocoa libraries -
in fact you can't go wrong with starting out by reading through the official
books:

- [The Swift Programming Language](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11&ls=1)
- [Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id888894773?mt=11&ls=1)

You should also check out the official
[swift blog](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/), and some of the other
[resources](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/) made available by
Apple.

Since there is so much good info out there about how to use Swift, this post is
not going to attempt to cover any of that. Instead, it's going to run through
some of the important 

## Initialisation


## Mutability



## Strong Typing and `AnyObject`


## Protocol Conformance


## Enums





## Conclusion

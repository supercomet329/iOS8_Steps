## Introduction

Way back on [day 5](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2014/07/24/ios8-day-by-day-day-5-auto-sizing-table-view-cells/)
of this series, we took a look at the new functionality within table views that
allows cells to define their own height - using the power of auto layout. Well,
imagine a world where you could extend that same principle to collection views.
How cool would that be?

Well, in iOS8, you can! This functionality is built in to the flow layout, and
is easy to access when building your own layouts. In today's brief post you'll
discover how to use auto-sizing cells within a flow layout, and a little bit
about the underlying implementation. The sample app is available in the
iO8 Day-by-Day repo on github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

## Introduction

This series has covered three of the new extension points so far (sharing,
today & photo) and today sees the turn of the action extension.

The action extension is quite similar to the sharing extension - in fact it
appears on the same 'share-sheet' popover UI. The difference is very much with
the intent: the sharing extension is used for exactly what its name suggests -
extracting content from an app for the purpose of sharing it, either directly or
via a social network.

In contrast, the action extension is intended to perform fairly light-weight
transformations of the content - either providing their own UI or returning
updated content to the requesting app.

Today's article will demonstrate how to create an action extension,
specifically for manipulating the content of web pages. The source code for the
app, __MarqueeMaker__ is available on github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

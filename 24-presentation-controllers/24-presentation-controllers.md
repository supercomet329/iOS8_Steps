## Introduction

Back on [day 21](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2014/08/26/ios8-day-by-day-day-21-alerts-and-popovers/)
you saw how UIKit has been updated to give a more consistent approach to showing
alerts, popovers and action sheets. The technology underlying this uses
presentation controllers, which are new to iOS8. It's possible to provide
your own custom presentation controllers for use in view controller transitions
and presentations.

In today's article you'll learn about what exactly presentation controllers are
for, what they can do and how to create your own. The project which accompanies
today's post is called __BouncyPresent__ and shows how to use a custom
presentation controller to create a customized modal view controller
presentation. It uses some of the view controller transitioning animation
concepts introduced in iOS7 alongside the new presentation controller concepts
to create an easy-to-understand, reusable presentation component.

As ever, the source code is available on the ShinobiControls github, at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://www.shinobicontrols.com/iOS8-day-by-day).

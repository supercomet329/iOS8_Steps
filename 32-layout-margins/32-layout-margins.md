## Introduction

If you've been using the Pin menu in Xcode 6 then you might have noticed the addition of a slightly mystical option - __Constrain to margins__:

If you've left this option ticked then you'll have an idea what it does,
although at first the behavior can seem a little confusing.

Today's post digs down into what layout margins are, what the represent to the
Auto Layout system, how to use them in IB and how to use them in code. There is
an accompanying project which demos these concepts - but be warned - the
majority of it uses the storyboard. You can grab it on the ShinobiControls
github at

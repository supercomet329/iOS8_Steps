## Introduction

iOS8 Day-by-Day has looked at a couple of the new extensions in iO8 already -
the share extension and the today extension. In today's article you're going to
learn the basics behind the photo extension.

Extension points are ways that you can write your own code and functionality
which enhance the OS in more far-reaching ways than just your app. In the case
of photo extensions, you can create filters and more complex editing
functionality that will be available to the Photos app and any other apps which
request it.

The sample code which accompanies today's article builds a photo extension from
the chromakey core image filter that was used in day 19. You can get the source
code from the ShinobiControls github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

## Finalizing the Edit


## Resumable Editing



## Conclusion

Photo extensions are a quite specialized - unless your app is in the business of
providing custom image manipulation algorithms. That doesn't make them any less
cool - in fact the fact that Apple has opened up this kind of functionality is
really rather exciting for the platform.

In addition to all the easy-access retro-filters that we can all use to take
hipster photos of our food, I think it'll be really exciting to see what other
ideas people come up with. For example, you could use a photo extension to
implement a steganography algorithm right into a filter, and then use it from
the photos app. Pretty cool stuff.

The source code for today's algorithm is available, as ever, on the
ShinobiControls github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).

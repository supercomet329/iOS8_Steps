## Introduction

Although the Apple Watch was unveiled back in September 2014, developers have
only recently got hold of an SDK - hidden away inside iOS 8.2. It seems that the
Apple Watch has really caught the imagination of iOS developers from across the
world, and as such there have been loads of in-depth articles, opinion pieces
and videos created covering it. iOS8 Day-by-Day has always been intended to be
short overview of new technologies so that intermediate developers can hit the
ground running. Today's post on Apple Watch is no different. If you want to
learn everything there is to know about the SDK then read the documentation, and
then soak up the excellent content that's been created in the short time the SDK
has been alive.

This post will discuss what's different between an iOS app, and an Apple Watch
app, what we can do as developers, and a very quick guide to getting started.
The app that accompanies this post is called __NightWatch__ and provides the
wearer with instant access to some of the best quotes from this excellent movie.
(Well, I say excellent, I've never seen it, and hadn't actually heard of it until
I started this project.) The source code for the app is available on github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/iOS8-day-by-day).
